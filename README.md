 The objective to indefity the fraudulent transactions
 
There are three parts of this project:
#### Exploring the Data
#### Building the Neural Network
#### Visualizing the Data with t-SNE.
Used tensorflow for building the predictive model. After building the model for visualization and analysis used t-SNE to visualize the dataset in two dimensions . 
# Algorithms
 The project will use neural network for detectig frauds. Will use tensorflow library.
 
 
 # Tools and libraries
 jupyter notebook
 Tensorflow
 Pandas
