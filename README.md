## Credit Card Fraud Detection
Explore different methods to classify credit card data as fraud or not. The objective to indefity the fraudulent transactions
 
Various parts for the project:
#### Exploring the Data
This step involves data exploratation.
#### Building the Neural Network
#### Visualizing the Data with t-SNE.
Used tensorflow for building the predictive model. After building the model for visualization and analysis used t-SNE to visualize the dataset in two dimensions
